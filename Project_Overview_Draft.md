# Project Overview

## Topic
### Pet Adoption Speeds
Our team chose pet adoption speeds as out topic because as a group we havea all had pets and some of us currently have pets. However, seeing which factors may 
influence the speed at which animals are adopted is something we are wanting to investigate. Perhaps to also predict how fast a new animal would be adopted as well, 
taking into account breed, animal type, fur color, and so on.

### Source Data
Our dataset lists instances of pets that were, or are up for adoption. It lists both cats and dogs, and occasionally groups of pets that show up as one listing, but
have a greater quantity. Cleaning this data will be something we have to focus on in order to get accurate data.

### Questions to Answer
The questions we are seeking to answer is "what qualities make a pet desirable for adoption?" Through processing, cleaning, and analysing the data, we hope to find
the answer
