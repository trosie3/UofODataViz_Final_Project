# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python within Google Colab.

## Database Storage
Postgres(cloud) is the database we intend to use. 

## Machine Learning
A random forest classifier is what we are intending to use.

presentation into our dashboard to create a better story. W eare also creatively using filters within Tableau to make our presented information 
interactive, that way our audience can quickly have answers to questiond we may not be immidiately answering with our story
