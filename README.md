## Communication Protocols
Slack group: group_project_team_1
- Let the team know if you are going to miss class or a scheduled get together time
- Let the team know when requested when you can meet next
- @ Rosie when have a pull request so she can do merges to the main branch
- If struggling with anything don't hesitate reach out to team and/or Terra or Heather


#### Keep in mind for machine learning model & analysis
Which model did you choose and why?
Since we are looking at the what affects the speed of the adoption and there are 4 types of speed (classification) therefore we are using random forest classifier model.
We will also look at the individual variables vs the speed of the adoption using regression model and make graphs.


### How are you training your model?
- we obtained dataset from kaggle.
- Remove null values.
- Remove the columns that are irrevelent for our project.
- Train-test split
- Apply NLP to description field.

### What is the model's accuracy?
The model's accuracy score is 33%.

### How does this model work?
