# Pet_Finder_Adoption_Prediction

## Project Overview

### Pet Adoption Speeds
Our team chose pet adoption speeds as out topic because as a group we havea all had pets and some of us currently have pets. However, seeing which factors may 
influence the speed at which animals are adopted is something we are wanting to investigate. We are also wanting to find out  which factors have the largest effect on 
the speed of adoption.

### Source Data
Our dataset lists instances of pets that were, or are up for adoption. It lists both cats and dogs, and occasionally groups of pets that show up as one listing, but
have a greater quantity. Cleaning this data will be something we have to focus on in order to get accurate data.

### Questions to Answer
The questions we are seeking to answer is "what qualities make a pet desirable for adoption?" Through processing, cleaning, and analysing the data, we hope to find
the answer


## Communication Protocols
Slack group: group_project_team_1
- Let the team know if you are going to miss class or a scheduled get together time
- Let the team know when requested when you can meet next
- @ Rosie when have a pull request so she can do merges to the main branch
- If struggling with anything don't hesitate reach out to team and/or Terra or Heather


#### Keep in mind for machine learning model & analysis
Which model did you choose and why?
How are you training your model?
What is the model's accuracy?
How does this model work?
